### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am an interdisciplinary creator who specializes in machine learning, classical Chinese poetry, and religious studies. I search for the measurable ***Tao*** of creation, applying AI and other cutting-edge technologies in unexpected areas.

### Fun
- :atom: Mysticism: Iâ€™m currently working on **Quantitative Mysticism** (A discipline with few researchers that aims to use new technologies to quantify the study of divination, astrology and other occult practices). This is one of my works published on a WeChat official account: [*In the AI Era, How to Compare Mysticism Quantitatively?*](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5g5VZLNrwtjUNY1UV4_SXg) (*An Attempt to Evaluate the Validity of the Major Systems of Tarot by Word2Vec Word-Embedding Clustering Model Based on the Barnum Effect*).
